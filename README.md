# Wallet Cop

Wallet Cop helps you choose the best credit card for specific spending categories based on the cards you own.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone Repositories

- **Frontend** (this repo)
- **Backend**: Clone the backend repository from your preferred source.

### 2. Install Dependencies

For both frontend and backend folders, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Backend

In the backend folder:

```bash
npm run start
```

> Note: The backend is hosted on a free Render server, so initial requests may take a few seconds to wake up.

### 4. Run the Frontend

In the frontend folder:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the app in your browser — typically at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Usage Instructions

1. **Sign In**: Use a Google account to log in.
2. **Wait a Moment**: The backend may take a few seconds to wake up on first use.
3. **Add Cards**: Navigate to the Wallet tab and add cards (real or dummy).
4. **View Recommendations**: Return to the Dashboard and select a category to get the best card suggestion based on your wallet.
5. **Manage Cards**: You can favorite cards, and remove them from your wallet or favorites list as needed.
